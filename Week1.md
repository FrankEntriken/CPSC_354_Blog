# Week 1
## Beginning Haskell

### My specifications
MacOS Catalina 10.15.6
.zsh shell terminal (https://ohmyz.sh/)

### How I installed Haskell

`curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh`
`ghci`

I used to run Haskell in the default bash terminal, this process was slightly different:

`curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh`
`stack exec ghci`

There may be a requirement depending on your computer where the developer tools for Mac needs to be downloaded in order to run 'stack exec ghci'
