# Week 10, Continuing round_robin.lc

I enjoyed all of the assignments within this class. They were sequential, Assignment 1 fed into Assignment 2 and so on, and felt challenging enough that I was left satisfied upon completion. Although, I felt a minor exception to this when completing the last assignment, Assignment 3 part 2. I felt like I spent the majority of my time learning and understanding LambdaFun when it came to creating memory and seeing how I could interact with it using `:env`. When it came to the functions, I ended up finishing those much more quickly as I only had to write a few lines of code. Now, this may just be me but I would have enjoyed a slightly longer assignment that included a couple more in-depth functions. I had the idea to continue round_robin.lc and create some of my own functions that I think would be useful when interacting with a circular linked list. Although, I soon realized that LambdaFun does not support recursion in the same way that LambdaNat allowed us to, which meant that the functions I created would not run. Instead of scrapping this idea, I will instead continue to show off these functions. I will show where they went wrong and how I had hoped they would work within LambdaFun.

### `index`



cons
during finals week adding more work is not the solution
would require more work put into testing
